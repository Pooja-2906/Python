This is a simple Python-based cafe ordering system. I created a menu using a dictionary where item names are keys and prices are values. The user is greeted and shown the menu, then prompted to place an order. I used if-else conditions to check if the item exists in the menu and added its price to the total. After each item, I ask if the customer wants to add more. If yes, the next item is taken and added to the order. I also used .lower() to make the input case-insensitive and improve user experience. Finally, I show the total amount of the order."
